You approach the door of the house.
You are about to knock when the door opens and out steps a troll.
Eep! This is the troll's house!
The troll attacks you!
You feel a bit under-prepared for this, what with only having a tiny dagger.
Would you like to (1) fight or (2) run away?1
You do your best...
but your dagger is no match for the troll.
You have been defeated!
